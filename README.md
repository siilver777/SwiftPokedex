# SwiftyDex

This GitHub repository hosts my SwiftyDex app, made for my iOS Development class at school. 

## Requirements

This app was developed with **Swift 3** and Xcode 8. I've tested it only on iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 10.2, but there should not be any issues on other device (thanks, Auto-Layout and iPhone SE Simulator!).

The application relies on a custom API also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/siilver777/SwiftyDexAPI). Details on the API page.

You also need CocoaPods to install the libraries I use.

## Used libraries 

* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)
* [PKHUD](https://github.com/pkluz/PKHUD)
* [Facebook iOS SDK] (https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk)
