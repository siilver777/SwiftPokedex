# SwiftPokedex

This GitHub repository hosts my SwiftPokedex app, made for my iOS Development class at school. 

## Requirements

This app was developed with **Swift 3** and Xcode 8.1. I've tested it only on iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 10.1.1, but there should not be any issues on other device (thanks, Auto-Layout!).

The application relies on a custom API also available on GitHub : (link placeholder). Details on the API page.

You also need CocoaPods to install the libraries I use.

## Used libraries 

* Alamofire 4.0
* SwiftyJSON
* PKHUD
